Scans the target for open ports and then runs a deeper scan based on scan specifications. The port scan results will 
be written to portScan.txt and deeper scan results will be written to deepScan.txt.

### JamesSrvMails.py
In few instances, I couldn't get the RCE exploit to work and ended up having to enumerate all the users in the server 
and then browse through their mail for sensitive data. This script is for such an occurence. Assuming a James Server RAT 
is also configured, this script will enumerate all user, puddle through their mailboxes and prints their mails.

Reads mail from POP3 mail server, by exploiting the default configuration of Apache James Server v2.3.2 or with a 
working admin user:pass for James Remote Administrator Tool.
```
usage: JamesSrvMails.py [-h] [-p TARGETPORT] [-N NEWPASS] [-U JUSER] [-P JPASS] target

positional arguments:
  target         Target host

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -p TARGETPORT  Target Port. Default-4555
  -N NEWPASS     New password
  -U JUSER       James RAT user
  -P JPASS       James RAT pass

```

### postRoot.py
Collects target's data, post-root and writes them to /tmp/postSysData.txt. Also makes a copy of passwd
and shadow files on /tmp directory for ease of transfer to attacking host. More enumeration and transfer functionalities
were planned to be implemented in the future.
